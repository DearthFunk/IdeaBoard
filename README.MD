Unfinished, unworking project I started to try and create a custom idea board with custom voting mechanics.

Not hosted, not working. But will sort it out some time in the near future and get a working copy up and running. 


ORIGINAL TODO LIST
- theme creator/selector
- password constraints control
- reports module
- implement voting mechanics

- rework ModalIcons to work with images (depending on this, edit the profileImage directive for hidden button)
- idea controller, wrap new comment section in a form with required fields
